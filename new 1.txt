1.User should be able to add more than one sub order with same type. Orders needs to be maintained based on Sub-orders not as per the measurement or dress type. - Discussed and clear
2.Custom measurement type should be able to added and can be included in measurements name screen. - Discussed and clear
3.Measurename name list should be able to collapse or expand.- need Accordin view
4.There should be an option to clear or delete the measurement type. - this is not in scope hence need to handle depend data
5.I think no need to have default measurement type. While installing the application they should be capable of creating it, so there will not be any re-ordering issue will be there. - remove all default data while install
6. Handling of Dress material photo's will be able to handled easily if we maintain the Customer->Orders->Sub-Order->(Respective material can be attached with the respective orders) 
7.Need to show some more information in dashboard. like number list and status of an order. That order card can consists of order number and sub-order number which is in active and the status of the orders and list can have the filters to retrive the completed and pending orders. - Dashboard page
